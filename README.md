# Tetris
These are the codes for an online 2-player tetris game using websocket. But it requires a server to run the game. So I put a single player version here.

## To run a single player game
- Just click: https://star2dust.github.io/ws-tetris/
- The source files are in the folder `./tetris2`

## To run an online 2-player game
- Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/star2dust/ws-tetris/tree/master/tetris3)
- The source files are in the folder `./tetris3`
